    <h3>Below is a map showing a choropleth of Georgia and the population of workers</h3>

        <img src="./Georgia Workers.png" alt="Total Population of workers" width="500px">
        <p>In the map you are able to see the difference in population density of workers with the heavily populated counties having more workers than the rest. I decided to split the data into a equal quartile because I wanted to show the heavily populated points and how high their employment numbers are. If this map was made as percentages the data would likely be changed so the smaller counties would have more.</p>
